            PC browsers have an easy to access View Source feature that lets you view the source code of any webpage, but what about mobile browsers, such as
            the ones running on your Android smartphone or tablet?
        </p>
        <p>
            You can install an app (or two), but for the lighter and minimalist solution, you can try <b>SrcAnywhere</b>. Once added to your browser as a
            humble bookmark(let), just tap the address bar, start typing "src...", and select <b>SrcAnywhere</b> from the dropdown list that appears. The
            browser's built-in View Source feature will open in a new tab, revealing the HTML source code of the current webpage (with syntax highlighting
            included).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can customize and rename the <b>SrcAnywhere</b> bookmarklet to a shorter name if you like. As a bookmarklet, it does not waste any valuable
            resources, especially on resource constrained mobile devices. It doesn't require traditional installation, and even works on your desktop or
            portable PC, as a one click View Source alternative.

        <h2 class="section-heading">"Install" SrcAnywhere</h2>

        <!-- Start Bookmarklet -->
        <p><a class="btn btn-default" role="button" href='javascript:(function(){window.open(&quot;view-source:&quot;+location);})();'>SrcAnywhere</a></p>
        <!-- End Bookmarklet -->

        <p><b>On a PC:</b> Simply drag the button to your browser's bookmarks bar (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc.)</p>
        <p>
            <b>On a mobile device:</b> Chrome for Android synchronizes your bookmarks with the PC, so <b>SrcAnywhere</b> should automatically appear on your
            device. On other mobile browsers (such as Firefox), long tap the button and select <i>Bookmark Link</i>.
        </p>
        <p><b>SrcAnywhere</b> is <strong>free</strong> and <strong>Open Source</strong>. Read the
            <a href="/srcanywhere/license/" title="SrcAnywhere License Agreement"><b>SrcAnywhere</b> License</a> for more information. Or
            view <a href="https://gist.github.com/tecdrop/b2e6133aa941735c901a" target="_blank">the source code</a> on GitHub Gist.

        <p>
            Unfortunately, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767742.aspx" target="_blank">Internet Explorer</a> and Microsoft Edge do not
            support the <code>view-source:</code> protocol, so <b>SrcAnywhere</b> does not work with Microsoft's browsers.
