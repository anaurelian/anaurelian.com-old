        <p>Open the app on as many Android smartphones or tablets as you can, and even turn off the Internet, and the
           cellular network. You should see the same color and digit on all devices, changing every minute.</p>
        <p>The same sequence of colors and digits has been reported to appear on any Android device that has been
           tested, all around the world.</p>
        <p>This app does not request Internet permissions, and does not use network connections for synchronization.
           So how are the Androids talking to each other?</p>
        <p>Do they have a hive mind?</p>
        <p>What are they saying to each other?</p>
